Marijn's tips for grant writing
===============================

I'm in no way an expert on grant writing, but I want to become one.
In this document, I'll collect some of the things I've learned so far.

You should definitely go attend some grant writing seminars.
Especially the Q&A sessions with the grant reviewers are hugely beneficial.

However, in my experience so far, many grant writing seminars place excessive
focus on what the perfect grant application should look like:

 - ambitious (high risk, high reward)
 - but not reckless (i.e. well planned with contingencies for failure)
 - detailed
 - but also clear
 - exciting, a real page turner
 - etc.

but they are very scarce on guidance on how to actually get your grant application to be that way.
So I'll be focussing on that in this document.


Before you start writing...
---------------------------

...make an outline!
Changing a large swatch of written grant proposal takes a lot of effort.
Take advantage of the nimbleness of a simple bullet list and think things through before locking them down in writing.


### Coming up with the perfect research project

The following process worked for me:

 - Think about the *big* question you want to help with.  
 - Think and read about what we know so far.  
 - Think about the biggest reasons why we don't know more.
   What are the major roadblocks facing the field?  
 - Given your expertise, what big roadblock are you most effective at pushing against?
   Don't bother pushing against minor roadblocks, take on a big one!  
 - Finally, make a plan on how to move the roadblock as much as you can.
   What can you do in the X years the grant gives you to move the roadblock as far as possible?  

At the end of all this, you should have an idea for a project that you are very excited about actually doing.
If not, back to the drawing board!

Now that you know *what* you want to do, you have to think hard about *how* you're going to do it.

 - What study are you going to perform first?
 - How will you analyse the data?
 - What will the results be and how will you interpret them?
 - What will the title of the resulting publication be?
 - What will be the study after that?
 - etc.

When your aiming for post-doc level or higher, aim to have at least one of your planned publications be a Nature/Science paper. If everything goes completely according to your plan and the result would still not be good enough for a top tier publication, the roadblock you are pushing against is not important enough or the combined effort of your studies is not going to move it far enough, so it's back to the drawing board.
Think through the project until there are no more large unknown areas.
Write down the outline of your project.
Group the tasks into work packages.
Usually one study is one work package.
These work packages are going to be the foundation for the main text of your proposal.


### Step into the shoes of a reviewer

Download the grading sheet for reviewers from the funding agency's website.
Pretend to be a reviewer and pretend that the outline of your project is written into a full project proposal.
Until you score max points on everything, keep iterating the outline.
This also means adding collaborations, visits to research groups abroad, etc., whatever the reviewer needs to give full points.

When you're happy with the outline, you can move on and lock it down into writing.


Writing the grand application
-----------------------------

Grand writing seminars will tell you a god grand application is a real page turner.
More concretely, this means that the goal for the first sentence is to make the reviewer want to read the next sentence, and the next, and the next, until he/she finishes your entire application.

This begins at the title.
Presumably the reviewer is forced to read this, so you get this one for free.
The first thing the reviewer wants to know is: "What is this project about?"
So, that's your title.
A good idea for a grand application is have the title be the dramatic outcome of your project, should all go well.

Your title will hopefully make the reviewer genuinely interested in how you are going to pull the project off.
Hence, you should in the Introduction spend as little time as possible before getting to that point.
Any text you put before getting to it is rapidly draining the attention span of the reviewer.
However, you usually first must explain the roadblock you'll be pushing against, so say what you absolutely must, no more and no less.
Once you get to the sentence that explains what you're actually going to do, put it in bold so the eye is drawn towards it.


### The general guiding principle

My most important guideline when structuring an academic text, especially grand proposals, is the principle of "academic need".
This principle states that the reader must first *want* to know something, before you tell it.
All other "rules" follow from this principle.

Here is a (somewhat dramatised) example of a paragraph:


### Archetype paragraph

Topic sentence.

    Writer: "In my opinion, dogs are the best pets in the world."
    Reader: why would you think that? Dogs are rubbish! This writer is 
            clearly an idiot. But before I stop reading, let me just check
            what stupid reasons he gives for this ridiculous statement.

Supporting sentence #1.

    Writer: "For one, dogs are very loyal, so you can train them to fetch
            your slippers."
    Reader: I guess that *is* useful. Ok, so he may have *one* good point.
            "For one" implies that he has more reasons. I wonder if they
            are good too.
	
Supporting sentence #2.

    Writer: "But also, dogs will give you love and affection when everyone else
            is mad at you for that thing you did."
    Reader: I totally did that thing once! I guess I'm also lonely from time to
            time. Where is the writer going with this?

Concluding sentence.

    Writer: "Therefore, I strongly suggest you get a dog right now!"
    Reader: I'm totally convinced and will now go buy a dog. This article has
            changed my life forever. 
 

### The "flow" of a text

In order to create this interplay of academic need and fulfilling it, you need to keep close track of the topic of the sentence, paragraph, and section that you are currently writing.
The statements made by the individual sentences should form a clear "flow" from the beginning to the end of the paragraph.
The topics of each paragraph should also form a clear flow within the section.
Of course, the sections themselves should form a clear structure within the document, which is usually pre-defined by the template (e.g. introduction, methods, results, conclusion).

There are some useful rules/guidelines that make it easier to trace a path:

 - strictly one topic per paragraph.
 - strictly one statement per sentence.
 - begin (or end) each paragraph with a clear topic sentence.
 - use appropriate (not random!) transition words (however, also, therefore, etc.)
 - avoid "branching" as much as possible; always prefer continuing an existing line of reasoning over starting a new one.


### A successful grand application structure

My grand applications all have a similar structure that is centered around the work packages.

After getting your introduction to the point where you can state what you're going to do (your first sentence in bold), you go over the background information needed to understand each work package.
When writing the background information, your goal is to get to a single summary sentence explaining what you're going to do in the first work package.
All the text before that is meant to present the context needed for the reader to understand the summary sentence, no more and no less.
Then, move on to the next work package, which will be a logical continuation of the first.
Put the summary sentences in bold so they cut up the text into blocks, each block describing a work package.

Make the Objectives section very systematic.
Make sub-headers according to the work packages.
For each work package:

 - explicitly state the research question you're going to address
 - explain exactly how you're going to address the research question
 - if it's a risky work package, lay out a contingency plan
 - describe how the expected results will look like
 - point out the impact: how the results move the roadblock you're pushing against (important!).

I don't have any clear advice yet on the other sections.
